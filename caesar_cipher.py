# Option 1 Difficulty Level: Elementary: One of the first known
# examples of encryption was used by Julius Caesar. Caesar needed
# to provide written instructions to his generals, but he didnâ€™t want
# his enemies to learn his plans if the message slipped into their hands.
# As result, he developed what later became known as the Caesar Cipher.
# The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as a result, it provides
# no protection against modern code breaking techniques). Each letter in the
# original # message is shifted by 3 places. As a result, A becomes D,
# B becomes E, C becomes F, D becomes G, etc. The last three letters in the alphabet
# are wrapped around to the beginning: X becomes A, Y becomes B and Z becomes C.
# Non-letter characters are not modified by the cipher. Write a program that
# implements a Caesar cipher. Allow the user to supply the message and the
# shift amount, and then display the shifted message. Ensure that your program
# encodes both uppercase and lowercase letters. Your program should also support
# negative shift values so that it can be used both to encode messages and decode
# messages. (please see the attached image for more detail)
