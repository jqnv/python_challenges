# Option 1 Difficulty Level: Elementary: In this exercise you will
# create a program that displays a multiplication table that shows
# the products of all combinations of integers from 1 times 1 up to and
# including 10 times 10. Your multiplication table should include a row of
# labels across the top of it containing the numbers 1 through 10.
# It should also include labels down the left side consisting of
# the numbers 1 through 10. The expected output from the program is shown...
def multiplication_table():
    table = []
    for i in range(1, 11):
        table.append(list(range(i, i * 10 + 1, i)))
    for n in range(1, 11):
        print("\t", n, end="")
    print("")
    for i in range(10):
        print(i + 1, end="")
        for j in range(10):
            print("\t", table[i][j], end="")
        print("")
