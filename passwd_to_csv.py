# For this exercise, create a function, passwd_to_csv, that takes two filenames as arguments: the first is a
# passwd-style file to read from, and the second is the name of a file in which to write the output.The new fileâ€™s
# contents are the username (index 0) and the user ID (index 2).Note that a record may contain a comment,
# in which case it will not have anything at index 2; you should take that into consideration when writing
# the file.The output file should use TAB characters to separate the elements.

# To run the file at the command line Prompt>python passwd_to_csv.py in_file.csv out_file.csv
import csv

    with open(f_in, mode="r") as f_input:
        for line in f_input:
