# Python uses the # character to mark the beginning of a comment. The comment ends at the end of the line containing
# the # character. In this exercise, you will create a program that removes all of the comments from a Python source file.
# Check each line in the file to determine if a # character is present. If it is then your program should remove all of
# the characters from the # character to the end of the line (weâ€™ll ignore the situation where the comment character
# occurs inside of a string). Save the modified file using a new name that will be entered by the user. The user will
# also enter the name of the input file. Ensure that an appropriate error message is displayed if a problem is
# encountered while accessing the files.

# To run de program: >python [name py file] [name of text file] [name of output file]
# Example: [prompt]>python remove_comments.py with_comments.txt no_comments_file.txt
